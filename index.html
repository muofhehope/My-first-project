       <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
       <p>
           Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. 
       </p>

       <p>
        Unlike <a href="getting-started.html">traditional climbing,</a> bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
       </p>

       <P>
        Experience the perfect blend of <span>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</span> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <span>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</span>
